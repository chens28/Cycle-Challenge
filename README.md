# Cycle_Challenge_Maps

The purpose of this project is to design a race map for the Butler County Donut Trail Cycle Challenge, which will be held on September 21st, 2019. The map must meet the following requirements: it must be suitable for use with a URL and be functional for bicyclists, as well as aesthetically pleasing. In addition, we will create both a web map and a paper map for each route in the challenge, in case there is a preference for using traditional paper maps.
